        ACK St. Faith’s Parish Ongata Rongai began on 28th March 1982 through a planning committee at St. Barnabas Church Otiende to plan for the formation of a new sub-Church at Ongata Rongai.

The proposed Church was given the Name ACK St. Faith’s by the then, Archbishop of Kenya, the Most Rev. Manasses Kuria on 16th July, 1982. The sub- Church committee comprising of members from St. Barnabas and Mbagathi Churches met at Mr. & Mrs. Sospeter Gichuru’s house on 18th July 1982 to plan the construction of a temporary church building at Ongata Rongai.

      <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-maroon-800 mb-6" data-aos="fade-right">History of the Anglican Church of Kenya (ACK)</h2>
      <p class="leading-relaxed text-lg mb-4" data-aos="fade-up">
        The Anglican Church of Kenya dates back to 1844 with the arrival of Dr. Ludwig Krapf in Mombasa. He was joined two years later by Rev. Johann Rebman. The two CMS intended to link a CMS station that was established at Rabai in the coastal region at the same time. The Missionaries had to study and learn African Languages in order to communicate and spread Christianity. This resulted to Krapf's translation of the book of Genesis chapter 1-3 in Kiswahili in 1847.
            <br>
            <br>
            In the same year, Krapf visited Ukambani in an evangelistic exploration while Rabman visited Taita. In 1848, Krapf translated St. Luke's Gospel in Nyika (Rabai) and in 1850, St. Mark's Gospel into Kamba (some local language). Three years later, Mringe a dying cripple became the first Anglican convert to be baptized. Later a colony was set up by CMS at free town for freed slaves. This became the venue for the baptism of the first Giriama converts. The Diocese of Eastern Equitorial Africa was formed in 1884 and it inclded Uganda, Kenya and Tanganyika with James Hannington as the first Bishop. One year after, ex-slaves Ishmael Semler and William Jones became the first Africans to be ordained to the Anglican Ministry. In October the same year, Bishop Hannington was brutally murdered on his way to Uganda. 
            <br>
            <br>
Divinity training for evangelists started in 1889 at CMS, Freetown. Nine years later, the Diocese of Mombasa was formed comprising the vast Kenya's geographical coverage and Northern Tanganyika. The First CMS Missionary A.W.McGregor arrived in Kabete in 1900 (currently Central Kenya) and three years later, the first Kikuyu Scriptures were published. The Swahili New Testament was completed in Mombasa in 1909 while the first Anglican baptisms in Western Kenya were conducted in Maseno and Kima a year later. In 1900, the Luo Community of Western Kenya first received the scriptures in "Dholuo", their own language. The entire Swahili Bible was finally completed in Mombasa in 1914 as the mass movement into the Churches in Nyanza and Central Kenya began in 1916.
            <br>
            <br>
            In 1921, St. John's Church Nairobi located at Jackson Road (currently Parliament Grounds) moved to Pumwani. In replacement of St. John's Church, the Highland Cathedral was started and St. Stephen Church Jogoo Road. The Language Translation Centre moved to Peel Gardens which has developed into ACK Language and Orientation School & ACK Nairobi Guest House. The famous Alliance High School, which is one of the country's leading Schools, was inaugurated in 1926 at Kikuyu by the Alliance of Protestant Missions, with only 26 students. That same year the New Testament, was completed in Kikuyu and Luo.
            <br>
            <br>
            The Church of the Province of East Africa was formed in 1955, which included Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, and the Seychelles. The church was established to provide a more localized structure for the Anglican Church in East Africa. The first Archbishop of the Church of the Province of East Africa was Geoffrey Fisher, who served from 1955 to 1961.
            <br>
            <br>
            In the following year, northern Tanganyika was removed from the Diocese of Mombasa, which then covered Kenya only. In 1930, the CMS divinity school was transferred from Freetown to Limuru; the current St. Paul's United Theological University. In replacement of St. John's Church, the Highland Cathedral was started and St. Stephen Church Jogo Road. A year later, Bible churchmen's Missionary Society (CMS) began working among the west suk (Pokot) and the Borana (Marsabit) communities. The First Scriptures in Borana and Pokot were completed in the year 1934 and 1936 respectively.

The First visit from the Ruanda Revival team took place in 1937 and meetings were held in Nairobi, Weithaga and Kabete among other places. Thereafter, in 1938 Kenya African Keswick convention was held in Kikuyu, with the Ruanda Revival Team as the speakers. In 1943, the Kenya Missionary Council was voted to become the Christian Council of Kenya (CCK). The Kahuhia convention which was to be the first African- Organized East Africa revival convention was held in 1947. This movement later spread across Central Africa.
            <br>
            <br>
            
The Union Swahili Bible was completed and published in 1952. I the same year, All Saint's Cathedral in Nairobi was completed and consecrated. The following year, Church House, also in Nairobi was opened while the Luo Bible was published. In 1954, Anglicans, Presbyterians and Methodists jointly established St. Paul's United Theological College in Limuru, (currently United Theological University).
            <br>
            <br>
            The first African Bishop of the Church of the Province of East Africa was Festo Olang' who was elected in 1970. The Church of the Province of East Africa was renamed the Anglican Church of Kenya (ACK) in 1998. The ACK has grown to become a vibrant and dynamic church with a strong presence in Kenya and beyond.
            <br>
            <br>
            The ACK is a member of the worldwide Anglican Communion, which is a family of churches in communion with the Church of England. The church is committed to the mission of God, which includes evangelism, discipleship, and social justice. The ACK is also involved in various ministries, including education, health care, and community development.
            <br>
            <br>
            The ACK is governed by a synod, which is made up of bishops, clergy, and lay representatives from each diocese. The church is led by the Archbishop of Kenya, who is elected by the synod. The current Archbishop of Kenya is Jackson Ole Sapit, who was enthroned in 2016.
            <br>
            <br>
            The ACK is a church that values diversity and inclusivity. It welcomes people from all walks of life, regardless of their background or status. The church is committed to promoting social justice and advocating for the rights of the marginalized and vulnerable members of society.
            <br>
            <br>
            The ACK is also committed to the environment and sustainable development. The church has established various programs and initiatives aimed at promoting environmental conservation and sustainable use of natural resources. The ACK believes that caring for God's creation is an integral part of its mission and ministry.
            <br>
            <br>
            The ACK is a church that is rooted in the Anglican tradition, which emphasizes the importance of scripture, tradition, and reason. The church believes in the authority of the Bible and seeks to interpret it in light of contemporary issues and challenges. The ACK also values the sacraments, particularly baptism and Holy Communion, as means of grace and spiritual nourishment.
